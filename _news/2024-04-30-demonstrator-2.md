We have extended the demonstrator of the SubSift matching application. SubSift
was originally developed by the Intelligent Systems Laboratory at the
University of Bristol as an innovative “submission sifting” application to
support academic peer review. The first demonstrator included a pre-defined set
of people from the TAILOR project that could be match to arbitrary text. The
match was based on the set of previous publications available in their DBLP
article repositry.

In this extension, we have included an explanation for each match using
Shapley values, and the option to upload your own data to match to free text
and obtain an explanation. 

The demonstrator can be accessed at the following [link][demo]. This link may
take up to one minute to launch initially.

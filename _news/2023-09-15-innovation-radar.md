The European Commission's Innovation Radar has highlighted the SubSift tool of
WP9 as an excellent innovation (link to appear before the 23rd of September
here https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/). WP9 is using AI-powered
collaboration tools to facilitate the search for experts in given contexts.
SubSift has been used in various TAILOR Conferences and a Summer School to
match like-minded attendees. It is currently in an exploratory phase and WP9 is
working on extending a demonstrator with additional transparency and
explainability functionalities ([link][demo]). Future plans involve the
integration of SubSift with the AI-on-demand platform
(https://www.ai4europe.eu/) to provide AI-powered search functionalities across
its catalog.

The demonstrator can be accessed at the following [link][demo]. This link may
take up to one minute to launch initially.

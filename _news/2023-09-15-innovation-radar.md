The European Commission's Innovation Radar has highlighted the SubSift tool of
WP9 as an excellent innovation
([innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/innovation/51621](https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/innovation/51621)).
WP9 is using AI-powered
collaboration tools to facilitate the search for experts in given contexts.
SubSift has been used in various TAILOR Conferences and a Summer School to
match like-minded attendees. It is currently in an exploratory phase and WP9 is
working on extending a demonstrator with additional transparency and
explainability functionalities. Future plans involve the integration of SubSift
with the AI-on-demand platform
([www.ai4europe.eu](https://www.ai4europe.eu/)) to provide AI-powered
search functionalities across its catalog.

The demonstrator can be accessed at
[subsift-webapp.onrender.com/subsift/](https://subsift-webapp.onrender.com/subsift/),
which may take up to one minute to launch initially.

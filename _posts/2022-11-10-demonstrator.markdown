We have released a demonstrator of the SubSift matching application.  SubSift
was originally developed by the Intelligent Systems Laboratory at the
University of Bristol as an innovative “submission sifting” application to
support academic peer review. Within the TAILOR project the application has
been extended to match arbitrary text to a pre-defined set of people, based on
the similarity of the text to titles of published works in the DBLP article
repository.

The demonstrator can be accessed at the following [link][demo]. This link may
take up to one minute to launch initially.

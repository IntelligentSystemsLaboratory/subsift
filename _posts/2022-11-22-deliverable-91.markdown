The report for the deliverable 9.1 is now available in the following
[link][d91].

This report describes the SubSift matching algorithm as an AI-tool that can be
used to facilitate the collaboration and networking of researchers. This tool
allows to rank a set of people by expertise with respect to a provided text.
This can be used to find potential collaborations that were previously unknown,
or even to match people with similar interests.  In preparation for this
deliverable we have applied the algorithm successfully in two TAILOR events,
which is described in their respective deliverables and summarised in this
report. In this deliverable we provide an online public demonstrator v.1.0 of
the tool, which can be used by researchers to find possible collaborators among
the TAILOR partner representatives. We expect TAILOR and non-TAILOR members to
use the tool to explore the expertise of the TAILOR partners to potentially
start new collaborations.  Furthermore, in the appendix we present information
about a workshop organised by TAILOR which provides additional AI-tools to
facilitate the collaboration of AI researchers.

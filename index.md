SubSift is a collection of tools developed in Bristol for matching academic
researchers and text. It works by converting text documents to a
bag-of-word representation using TF-IDF, and calculating pairwise cosine
similarities. For researchers, publication titles as listed on their DBLP page
are converted to BoW. A demo can be found at
[https://subsift-webapp.onrender.com/subsift/](https://subsift-webapp.onrender.com/subsift/) (it may take 30 seconds to load
the first time).
